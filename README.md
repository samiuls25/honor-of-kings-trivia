## Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS custom theme (no UI framework dependency)

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies.
2. Start dev server.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To test the Netlify share metadata endpoint locally (optional):

1. Install Netlify CLI.
2. Run local Netlify dev server.

```bash
npx netlify dev
```

Build production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploy notes (important)

If you deploy only the `dist` folder manually, `/share` metadata links will not work because the Netlify function is outside `dist`.

Use one of these deployment methods so the function is included:

1. Git-connected Netlify site (recommended): Netlify builds and deploys from source.
2. Netlify CLI deploy with functions:

```bash
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --functions=netlify/functions
```

Function and routing files:

- `netlify/functions/share.js`
- `netlify.toml`

## Real data ingestion workflow

This project includes a real-data pipeline from exported network capture to app-ready TypeScript data.

1. Export a capture file from browser devtools on the official skin page.
2. Save as either:
  - data/raw/hok-skins-capture.har
  - data/raw/hok-skins-capture.json
3. Run full pipeline:

```bash
npm run ingest:all
```

You can also run steps individually:

```bash
npm run ingest:extract
npm run ingest:validate
npm run ingest:generate
```

Additional source-isolated pipelines:

```bash
# Secondary skins source (qing API) -> src/data/skins.qing.generated.ts
npm run ingest:qing:all

# OST playlist fetch + normalization -> src/data/ost.generated.ts
npm run ingest:ost:all
```

`ingest:qing:all` now includes an automatic Chinese -> English translation step before validation and generation.

`ingest:ost:all` now auto-fetches playlist metadata from the Honor of Kings Audio Team channel (free, no API key), then normalizes and generates runtime OST data.

Output files:

- data/processed/skins.normalized.json
- data/processed/meta.json
- src/data/skins.generated.ts
- data/processed/skins.qing.normalized.json
- data/processed/meta.qing.json
- src/data/skins.qing.generated.ts
- data/processed/ost.normalized.json
- data/processed/ost-meta.json
- src/data/ost.generated.ts

At runtime, the app now keeps skin sources separated and lets you choose the active source in setup/gallery:
- Official Capture (recommended quality)
- qing API (translated to English)
- Hybrid backfill

The app keeps source separation intact:
- Existing website capture extractor remains primary and highest quality.
- qing API is translated and can be selected independently (or in hybrid mode).
- qing thumbnail crop parameters are stripped during ingest to improve image quality.
- OST dataset is independent and never overwrites skin capture files.

## OST source file format

Auto-fetch command:

```bash
npm run ingest:ost:fetch
```

This writes playlist-derived metadata into `data/raw/hok-ost-source.json`, then `npm run ingest:ost:all` makes OST mode playable.

You can still provide your own manual OST source file at `data/raw/hok-ost-source.json` if you prefer.

Example custom shape:

```json
[
  {
    "trackTitle": "Track Name",
    "artistName": "Honor of Kings Audio Team",
    "videoId": "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID",
    "imageUrl": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg"
  }
]
```

## Data model

The dataset shape used by the app is:

- id
- heroId
- heroName
- heroAliases[]
- skinName
- skinAliases[]
- imageUrl
- source

Special thanks to qing762 for his api that provided a fuller dataset than what I originally had. API Source: https://github.com/qing762/honor-of-kings-api
